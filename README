RAW - Rewritten Another World engine for SEGA SATURN.

This is a BETA version of RAW port to SEGA SATURN game console,
with this you will be able to play "Another World" ("Out of this
World" in USA) game on your favourite console :-)

YOU WILL NEED THE ORIGINAL DATAFILES OF THE GAME TO PLAY WITH THIS PORT!!!

Provided in the archive is the modified source code for the saturn port
and two binaries:
raw_cd.bin  -> You can use this to build your standalone RAW cd, with datafiles (renamed to 0.BIN)
raw_par.bin -> This is the version you can use to load the game through your Action Replay/PAR cart. 
               You'll still need a cd with the original datafiles in it though.

Sound driver needed at the root of the game disk is included.

GAME CONTROLS:
Digital cross -> directional movements
A -> Run/Kick/Fire
Z -> Enter a level code
Start -> Pause game

HOW TO PREPARE A GAME DISK:
To play with RAW, you need to own the original game to extract the datafiles.
You'll need the following files from the original game in the root of the disk:

After having copied everything you need into cd_root directory (renamed binary too),
you'll have to generate the iso file. On linux you can use mkisofs this way:
mkisofs -quiet -sysid "SEGA SATURN" -volid "SaturnApp" -volset "SaturnApp" \
-publisher "SEGA ENTERPRISES, LTD." -preparer "SEGA ENTERPRISES, LTD." -appid "SaturnApp" \
 -abstract "ABS.TXT" -copyright "CPY.TXT" -biblio "BIB.TXT" -generic-boot ip.bin -full-iso9660-filenames -o raw.iso ./

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
* As far as i've seen, the game works OK, i could use a millisec precision timer for better
  music syncronization, but the SBL pcm library forbids me to reinitialize the FRT.
* Saving/Loading from backup memory is not implemented (nor really needed, you can use
  game access codes to go to the desired level).
* Game works fine at 50hz on pal consoles, but i still consider it a much better experience
  when played at 60hz.

All my code is to be considered under GPLv3 license.

I WON'T PROVIDE GAME DATAFILES IN THIS ARCHIVE BECAUSE UNAUTHORIZED REDISTRIBUTION WOULD BE ILLEGAL!!!
